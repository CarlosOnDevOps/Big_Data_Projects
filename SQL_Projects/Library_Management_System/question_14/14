Question 14:
List the first and last names of the authors that wrote books in more than one genre

-- I was aware that I would need to look at the Author and Book tables, respecively--Author for the names and Book for the number of genres
-- I chose the FirstName and LastName fields from the Book table using SELECT
-- labeled them differently so end-data looks more legible
-- I was able to link the data tables together using an Inner Join because the connected AuthorId exists in both the Author and Book table
-- I counted the number of different books with genre counts greater than one using COUNT and DISTINCT
-- one genre was the focus of all the books of several authors essentially author > many books but none had multiple genres
